Utilizing Proxies with Zotero for Enhanced Research Access.

Academic institutions often grant access to subscription-based journals and databases through proxy servers. Configuring a proxy in Zotero allows users to access these resources effortlessly, eliminating the need for repeated manual logins.

# Advantages of Configuring a Proxy in Zotero
Effortless Access: Enjoy seamless connectivity to subscription-based academic papers.
Automatic Detection: Zotero can automatically identify and redirect requests through your institution’s proxy for sites requiring authentication.
Streamlined Workflow: Save time by bypassing manual authentication steps.

# Step-by-Step Instructions for Proxy Setup in Zotero
1. Install the Zotero Connector
Begin by installing the Zotero Connector in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). This extension is crucial for saving research materials directly from the web and supports proxy redirection.

Select Preferences from the drop-down menu.
In the Preferences window, go to the Proxies tab.

3. Enable Proxy Redirection
Within the Proxies tab, activate proxy redirection:

Check the box labeled “Enable proxy redirection” to allow Zotero to automatically route you through your institution's proxy server when accessing restricted content.

4. Add Your Institution’s Proxy
To add your institution’s proxy details:

Click on Add Proxy within the Proxies tab.
Enter your institution’s proxy server details, typically formatted as:
https://proxy.universityname.edu
For specific proxy details, consult your university’s library website or ask a librarian.
Click OK to save the settings.

5. Customize Proxy Settings (Optional)
Zotero offers customization options for proxy handling:

Automatic Recognition: Enable Zotero to automatically recognize resources requiring proxy access.
Hostnames: Add specific hostnames for frequently accessed sites like JSTOR or ScienceDirect. Click Add Hostname and input the URL to ensure automatic redirection through the proxy.

6. Verify Your Proxy Configuration
To confirm the proxy setup:

Access a site provided by your institution, such as JSTOR or ScienceDirect.
If configured correctly, Zotero will automatically redirect you through your institution’s proxy, granting access to subscription content.

7. Save Research Materials with Zotero
With the proxy configured, you can save research materials directly from your browser using the Zotero Connector:

On a research article or journal page, click the Zotero icon in your browser toolbar.
Zotero will save the citation and available full text into your library for easy reference.
